# Hi There!

My name is Barry and I'm from NYC. I'm the [Director of Technical Product at DoSomething.org](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bazclark) where I help manage our team of developers.

I love building things, but more than anything I enjoy helping other aspiring developers create sensational careers doing what they love—writing code. If you're a fellow developer, just starting out, or looking to get your first serious job in web development, this site is for you.

The best place to start is with [my free newsletter]({{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter) where I deliver content twice per month that'll help you get hired as a web developer.

## 6 Random Facts About Me

1. I'm originally from Edinburgh, Scotland.
2. I keep a running list of [things I want to do before I die]({{ site.baseurl }}/bucket-list).
3. I was a Professional Poker Player for 3 years—once turning $10 into $100,000.
4. I occasionally write for [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com).
5. I designed and programmed a number of the gunfights and car chases in Grand Theft Auto 4.
